# 💰 **Giga Chads Spending Dashboard**

Welcome to the sacred vault of the **Giga Chads** — where money is spent with the elegance of a ₹10 chai in a ₹50 Uber ride. ☕🚗

This dashboard exists to solve life’s most critical mysteries:
- *Who’s sipping chai like they’re building an empire, one cutting at a time?* 🫖👑  
- *Why does “miscellaneous” cost more than rent?* 🧾  
- *And who the hell bought ₹600 worth of Maggi at 2 AM?* 🍜🔥

We’re not here to point fingers — just bar charts.  
So relax, sip your chai, and track the financial chaos like the true Giga Chad you are.  
> *Because behind every broke legend is a perfectly plotted graph.* 📈💥

Let the roast... I mean, **analysis** begin! 😎🔥
